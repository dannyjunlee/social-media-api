# Social Media API

## Description

This project is a social media API utilizing the Mongoose package to connect to the MongoDB database. I built this project because the flow of the project is comparable to a real-life social media application, so it provided me a tremendous learning opportunity to undertake the project and gain a feel for how such projects work. This project has a recurring theme behind it of providing users with a social media platform that takes away many of the negatives that current social media platforms have, hence the idea of "thoughts" and "reactions" rather than simple posts or comments. This project can serve as the groundwork for an actual social media application that strives to achieve those goals.

## Installation

This project requires the use of the Express and Mongoose packages. It is also helpful to install Nodemon as a developer wishing to test the code.

`npm i`

The above code will install the necessary dependencies/packages.

## Usage

Type the following two lines into the terminal in order to get the sample database seeded and the server live:

`npm run seed`

`npm run dev`

From there, users may explore the application through the local browser or Insomnia. Some example routes include:

GET: http://localhost:3001/api/users

GET: http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts
